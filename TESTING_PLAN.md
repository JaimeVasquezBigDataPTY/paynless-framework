**Consolidated Project Testing Plan & Status (v4 - Reflecting Local Integration Limitations)**

**Notes & Key Learnings (Summary):**

*   **Local Runtime Auth (`verify_jwt`):** The local Supabase runtime *does* respect function-specific `[functions.<name>] verify_jwt = false` settings in `config.toml`. This is crucial for allowing API key auth functions (`/login`, `/register`) to bypass the runtime's potentially overzealous default JWT checks. Failure symptom: `401 Unauthorized` with runtime logs showing "Missing authorization header".
*   **Dependency Injection & `serve`:** Using the DI pattern (`deps = defaultDeps`) for unit testability is viable, *but* the `serve` call at the end of the function file *must* explicitly pass the defaults: `serve((req) => handler(req, defaultDeps))`. Failure symptom: `TypeError` inside the function runtime.
*   **Deno Imports (`npm:`, `std` version):** Deno requires explicit handling for imports:
    *   Use the `npm:` prefix for Node packages like `@supabase/supabase-js` (e.g., `npm:@supabase/supabase-js`).
    *   Use a recent, compatible version of the Deno Standard Library (`std`) matching the runtime (e.g., `std@0.224.0` for `serve`). Failure symptoms: `worker boot error` (relative path), `ReferenceError` (undefined function).
*   **Environment Variables & `supabase start`:** As documented below under "Known Limitations", `supabase start` (even CLI v2.20.5) does **not** reliably inject environment variables from `.env` files into the function runtime for local integration testing. `--env-file` is not supported by `start`. Manual loading attempts fail due to permissions.
*   **Deno Test Leaks:** `fetch` calls in tests must have their response bodies consumed (`await res.json()`, `.text()`) or closed (`await res.body?.cancel()`) to avoid resource leak errors.
*   **Profile Auto-Creation:** Local Supabase setup automatically creates `user_profiles` rows. Tests modifying profiles must use `update` after initial user creation.
*   **Back-testing/Regression:** Refactoring or changes require re-running affected unit/integration tests. Unit tests need updating post-integration changes.
*   **Mocking SupabaseClient (TS2345):** Directly mocking the `SupabaseClient` in unit tests can lead to TS2345 errors (type incompatibility, often due to protected properties like `supabaseUrl`) if the mock object doesn't perfectly match the client's complex type signature. This is especially true if tests in the same file need to mock different *parts* of the client (e.g., `.from()` vs. `.functions.invoke()`), leading to inconsistent mock object shapes.
    *   **Solution:** Introduce a **Service Abstraction Layer**. Define a simple interface declaring only the methods needed by the handler. Implement the interface using the real `SupabaseClient`. Refactor the handler to depend on the interface. Unit test the handler by mocking the *simple interface*, which avoids the TS2345 error. (See `stripe-webhook/handlers/product.ts` and its service/test for an example). Test the service implementation's direct Supabase calls separately.
*   **Refactoring UI/Store Interaction Pattern:** We identified inconsistencies in how UI components (`LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`, `ProfileEditor`, subscription pages) interact with Zustand stores (`authStore`, `subscriptionStore`) regarding side effects like API calls, loading states, error handling, and navigation. The previous pattern involved components managing local loading/error state and sometimes triggering navigation *after* store actions completed.
    *   **New Pattern:** To improve separation of concerns, predictability, and testability, we are refactoring towards a pattern where:
        *   Zustand store actions encapsulate the *entire* flow: initiating the API call, managing the central `isLoading` state, managing the central `error` state, and handling internal app navigation (e.g., `navigate('/dashboard')` after successful login) directly within the action upon success.
        *   UI components become simpler, primarily dispatching store actions and reacting to the centralized loading and error states provided by the store hooks (`useAuthStore(state => state.isLoading)`, etc.) to render feedback. Local loading/error state in components is removed.
        *   For actions requiring *external* redirection (like Stripe Checkout/Portal), the store action will still return the necessary URL, and the calling UI component will perform the `window.location.href` redirect.
    *   **Impact:** This requires refactoring `authStore` (`login`, `register`, `updateProfile`), `subscriptionStore` (checkout, portal, cancel, resume actions), and the corresponding UI components (`LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`, `ProfileEditor`, `SubscriptionPage`).
    *   **Testing Implication:** Unit tests for affected stores and components, along with MSW integration tests (Phase 3.2) for Login, Register, Profile, and Subscription flows, will require significant updates and re-validation after this refactoring.

✅ **How to Test Incrementally and Correctly (Layered Testing Strategy)**
*This remains our guiding principle.* 

**NOTE:** When running tests, especially suites or complex component tests, pipe the output to `test-output.log` to avoid terminal buffer issues and allow for easier review of results. Example: `pnpm --filter <package> test <file> > test-output.log`.

🧪 **1. Start with Unit Tests**
- Write unit tests for the file or module you're working on.
- Run the unit test(s) for that file.
- Fix the code until all unit tests pass.

🧩 **2. Move to Integration**
- Once all relevant unit tests pass, run integration tests that depend on those files/modules.
- **LOCAL LIMITATION:** Be aware of the environment variable issue documented below for functions run via `supabase start`. Integration tests for functions relying on `.env` variables (like `api-subscriptions`) may need to be performed primarily in deployed Preview/Staging environments.
- If local integration tests fail, fix relevant files (may involve multiple modules or configuration like `config.toml`).
- Once integration tests pass (either locally or in deployed env), review and update unit tests if behavior/signatures changed.
- Rerun affected unit tests to ensure they still pass.

🚦 **3. Stabilize by Layer**
- Ensure all passing unit tests pass after updates.
- Ensure all passing integration tests pass after updates.
- Only then run the full passing test suite (unit + integration) across the workspace.

🌐 **4. End-to-End Validation**
- Once the system passes unit and integration layers (acknowledging local limitations), run full end-to-end (E2E) tests.
- Fix or update E2E tests and supporting mocks if needed.

## Testing Plan: Phase 1 - Backend Integration Details

**Goal**: Ensure backend functions (Supabase Edge Functions) integrate correctly with each other, the database (including RLS), and external services (Stripe test mode) in the local development environment *where possible*, and in deployed environments otherwise.

### Known Limitations: Local Integration Testing with `supabase start`
*(This section remains as added previously)*

**Context:** Integration tests involving Supabase Edge Functions are designed to run against a local Supabase stack launched via `supabase start`.

**Issue Encountered:** As of Supabase CLI v2.20.5, `supabase start` does **not** reliably load environment variables from `.env` files (e.g., `supabase/.env.local`, `supabase/functions/.env`) into the Edge Function runtime environment, even when those files exist and contain the necessary variables (like Stripe API keys).

*   The `--env-file` flag, while functional with `supabase functions serve`, is **not** recognized by `supabase start`.
*   Manual loading attempts within shared function code (e.g., `_shared/stripe-client.ts` attempting to read `.env.local`) fail, likely due to the Deno runtime's default permission restrictions (missing `--allow-read` or `--allow-env`) within the sandbox created by `supabase start`. Diagnostic logs added to these loading attempts do not appear, suggesting the code block fails or is suppressed before logging can occur.

**Symptoms:**
*   Edge Functions that depend on environment variables set via `.env` files (e.g., `api-subscriptions` needing `STRIPE_SECRET_TEST_KEY`) fail during integration tests when run against `supabase start`.
*   These failures often manifest as `500 Internal Server Error` responses, originating from the function's inability to initialize dependencies (like the Stripe client) due to missing API keys/secrets.
*   Using `supabase functions logs --source <function_name>` confirms that `Deno.env.get()` returns `undefined` for the expected variables within the function runtime.
*   Running the same function using `supabase functions serve --env-file supabase/.env.local <function_name>` *does* successfully load the environment variables (confirmed via logs), indicating the function code itself is likely correct but needs the variables provided.

**Consequence:**
*   Full local integration testing (`
